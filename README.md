# PasswordApp
Added stater code to main branch

I used replays of past class videos and W3 school to help with this assignment.
Cerated the java-work branch to start working on the code

made array for lower case, upper case, numbers, and special chatacters.  

Made a get prompts function for the pop up for letters, numbers, and special chatacters.
If a number was not put in in the first pop up made a return false for the user to try again.

Added a for loop for the lenght of the password with a math floor and math random. To match the input given by the user.

Added a if statement for rightPrompts. When the user answer the pop ups the updated password is displayed. 

rearranged the java code placement so the code is ran correctly.
